Which register is being used to hold the "readAddress" variable?
BX

At what address does your string start? At what address does your actual program start (i.e. the first instruction)?
0000 Strings starts
000D First instruction

What does the value does the IP register start at (before you run your program)? Where does this value come from?
000D Where the first instruction is.

What value is at memory address 0001h? Where does this value come from?
65 - ASCII for 'e' in "Hello".

What is output to the screen instead of "Hello World!"? Why did the message change?
"Hallo world!" since 61 is ASCII for 'a'.

Why did the program print the original (unaltered) "Hello World!" message again?
Because code was reloaded.

What is the difference between the "Stop" and "Reload File" buttons?
Reload reloads code into memory. Stop simply jumps to first instrcution.

How do you now change the contents of memory (not your ASM code) to make the program only print "Hello"?
Add '$' ASCII to memory block directly after the one holding 'o'.

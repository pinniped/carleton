MILESTONE 1 (Data structure definition)
	heap-m1.h
		Define structures to be used. Create prototypes for mmalloc() and mfree() and describe their input, out, and function.

MILESTONE 2 (Testing logic)
	assign4-m1.c
		Design test cases in main() for mmalloc() and mfree(). Test cases to consider:
			1.Allocating memory larger than heap has available (when heap has no allocations yet).
			2.Multiple normal allocations.
			3.Freeing normal allocations.
			4.Freeing allocations that do not exist.
			5.Allocating memory larger than heap has available (when heap has allocations).

MILESTONE 3 (Test implementation)
	assign4-m2.c
		Implement test cases using functions mmalloc() and mfree().

MILESTONE 4 (Function logic)
	heap-m1.c
		Create empty functions and create skeleton using comments (pseudo-code).

MILESTONE 5 (mmalloc implementation)
	heap-m2.h
		Define any helper functions needed in the implementation of mmalloc().
	heap-m2.c
		Create and implement helper functions for mmalloc(). Implement code for mmalloc().

MILESTONE 6 (mfree implementation and final cleanup)
	heap-m3.h
		Define helper functions for mfree().
	heap-m3.c
		Implement helpers for mfree(). Implement mfree().
